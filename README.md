In statistics, exploratory data analysis is an approach of analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization methods.

EDA techniques allow for effective manipulation of data sources, enabling data scientists to find the answers they need by discovering data patterns, spotting anomalies, checking assumptions, or testing a hypothesis.
The four types of EDA are univariate non-graphical, multivariate non- graphical, univariate graphical, and multivariate graphical.

What are the two goals of exploratory data analysis?
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves using graphics and visualizations to explore and analyze a data set. The goal is to explore, investigate and learn, as opposed to confirming statistical hypotheses.
